1. Availability (uptime)
- resources are available when needed
- focuses on ensuring maximum availability, regardless of disruptions or events that may occur
- uptime guarantees are part of the service-level agreements (SLAs)

2. Scalability (ability to handle demand)
- ability to scale means you can add more resources to better handle the increased demand. 
- If demand drops off, you can reduce your resources and thereby reduce your costs.
- types of scaling:
    1. Vertical: increasing or decreasing the capabilities of resources
    2. Horizontal: adding or subtracting the number of resources

3. Reliability
- ability of a system to recover from failures and continue to function
- With a decentralized design, the cloud enables you to have resources deployed in regions around the world
- if one region has a catastrophic event other regions are still up and running

4. Predictabiltiy
- you have a solution whose cost and performance are predictable.
    1. Performance: Autoscaling, load balancing, and high availability are just some of the cloud concepts that support performance predictability.
    2. Cost: monitor resources to ensure that youâ€™re using them in the most efficient way, and apply data analytics to find patterns and trends that help better plan resource deployments
